# ProceduralGeneration

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

First Attemp In Learning (FAIL) Procedural Generation

Procedural, anything having this term is same as implying it will be a hard subject. But hard as it is, the impact that it brings to life is devastating. It can be apply in almost anywhere, as long as you can do 2 things: limit the range of works and a set of condition to follow. In this case I will focus on the gaming side, specificially, procedural terrain generation. Although game engine and 3d applicaition all have tools for procedural (and I have also used them a lot, since the convenience is just too obvious), but now that I start to dive into the logic behind it, the hard part show up: where do I even start learning. So I just go around the net seaarching for a key word "procedural generation", from reddit to youtube, from stackoverflow to papers, and after two days I came across this https://web.archive.org/web/20170812230846/http://www.gameprogrammer.com/fractal.html which gave me a direction to start with 2d, and the simple approach is midpoint displacement. In summary, this is just a dev log or more like my learning progress using Unreal Enigne!!!

Day 1:
-Implement draw lines and draw points
-Implement midpoint displacement
